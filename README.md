# Surf's Up

## Overview

For this project we were asked to analyze temperature and precipitation data in order to see which locations would best fit for a surf and ice cream shop. We also did this analysis on the months of June and December in order to see if the business was viabke to run year round.

## Results

There aren't many differences in the two datasets, at least not any that you wouldn't expect given the sampling times. However, the three that we are most concerned about are:

   * June has a higher mean temperature by about 4 degrees
   * The minimum temperature in December is around 8 degrees colder than June
   * And the sample size for June is about 200 days larger than December, but both are over 1500
   
## Summary

After reviewing the data I would personally say that the business is viable to run year round. The max temps in December almost match the max temps of July, meaning that the lows are likely early morning or late night temps when the shop would likely be closed. As far as additional queries, I would run the same analysis for January as it can also be a very cold month. Also I would try and get surf data such as wave height and tide levels to see if the potential shop locations have good surf.
